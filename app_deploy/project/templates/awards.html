              These values were chosen based on how common the award is for high school seniors as well as the difficulty of receiving one. For example, many high school seniors are part of NHS, so this award is less prestigious than a state award, for example. The total number of points corresponds to a type of college using the following ranges: 
              <br><br><table class="table">
                <thead>
                  <tr>

          More Information on Awards
        </h3>
          <p id="info">
            For a student hoping to be accepted to some of the nation's best universities, having a range of awards is a must. Awards can who that a student wisely uses their time after school on other involvements, like sports, music, or volunteering. Awards vary vastly in prestige, so one national award can be quite different from another one. Still, every award shows dedication and success of a student.<br><br>Colleges look for a well-rounded class, but not necessarily well-rounded students. Thus, being well-rounded is great, but it is also wise to show colleges a focus in your extracurricular involvements. Thus, it is particularly impressive if a college sees an award in the area of your anticipated major. This shows that you have already explored that field and are decisive.<br><br>Even if you are not aiming for Ivy League level colleges, award can still help your application. A local or even a school award can be helpful in showing what is meaningful to you. <br><br>Just a note on academic awards (like AP or NHS): if you have more awards that space to list them, list academic awards last. Colleges can see your grades and AP scores (if you send them), so putting AP awards on your list is redundant. Showcase your extracurriculars instead. <br><br>For more information about honors and awards, check out <a href='https://blog.collegevine.com/reporting-honors-and-awards-in-the-common-app/'>this article</a>.
